# TODO: Modify this file to create a shell script that is able to use awk to go through a file formatted like pokemon.dat and provides a printed report in the following format (where your script correctly calculates the values that go into the [VALUE] placeholders):
# ======= SUMMARY OF POKEMON.DAT ======
#    Total Pokemon: [VALUE]
#    Avg. HP: [VALUE]
#    Avg. Attack: [VALUE]
# ======= END SUMMARY =======

# The "Avg." values should be calculated as mean values for the corresponding columns.
# The spacing and header formatting should match the above formatting description exactly.
# There should be a comment explaining the purpose of each line in your shell script. 
# The data file will be passed in to the script as a positional parameter and will not necessarily be called pokemon.dat. However, you can assume that any file passed to this script will be formatted exactly the way pokemon.dat is formatted.

if [ $1 ]
then
#The echo line simply presents a heder that will be printed before outputting the requested data.
	echo "======= SUMMARY OF POKEMON.DAT ======="
#The awl script is used to take the averages of the hp and the attack in columns 6 and 7, denoted with $6 and $7 respectivley, wich should print a labled output.
#Awk is used to take the averages, 'awk', which discounts the header row, while the script in '{}' is used to do the actual math. 
	
	awk -F'\t' '{row += 1; hp += $6; attack += $7}; END{print "Total Pokemon: "row-1; print " Avg. HP: "hp/(row-1); print " Avg. Attack: "attack/(row-1)}' $1

#The echo line below simply prints a phrase to denote the end of the output
	echo "==== END SUMMARY ===="
